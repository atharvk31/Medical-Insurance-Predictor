# Medical-Insurance-Predictor

This project predicts individual medical insurance charges using machine learning based on attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more. It uses the Random Forest Regressor algorithm trained on a real-world dataset to estimate insurance costs accurately.

📌 Project Overview
With rising healthcare expenses, it's crucial for insurance companies to estimate the cost of insurance accurately and fairly. This project uses historical data to build a predictive model that helps:

Insurance providers set premium rates based on customer profiles.

Individuals understand how personal and health factors influence their insurance costs.
